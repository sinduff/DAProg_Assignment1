### Assignment Brief 

The purpose of the jupyter notebook **Assignnment 1 - Numpy.Random Package** is to explore the NumPy.random package in python, specificially;
 1. exploring the purpose of the NumPy.random package
 2. explaining how it generates simple randome data as well as the permultations functions
 3. exploring the distribution section, and demonstrating 5 distributions
 4. explaining the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom nubmers

The notebook has broken into five sections, four of which are outlined above.  Each section will include workings and sample code to demonstrate the different aspects of the NumPy.random package.  Examples of the different functions working in real world situations will also be included.

The fifth Section of the notebook includes the references used in this assignment.  References have also been included throughout by use of footnotes.  Hyperlinks to each reference has been included in the notebook also.

#### Examples 
A brief explanation of the examples used to illustrate the code with relvant example numbers are included below.  All examples should be run by the user as they read through the code. 

The code begins in cell [1] to import the python libriaries. Should the user not run this cell first, the code in subsequent cells will not run, and will display an error. This is followed by sample code to demonstrate building and displaying a sample array.

##### Section 1 
The examples in this section are;
- Example 1 - create and show a sample array using NumPy
  - Example 1a - generates a sample array using NumPy.random
- Example 2 - generate an array of 10 random intergers and print to screen

##### Section 2
The examples in this section are;
- Example 3 - set the random number generator to be a variable called 'rng'
- Example 4 - an example of the shuffle() method
- Example 5 - an example of the permutation() method

##### Section 3
The examples in this section are;
1. **Normal Distribution**
- Example 6 - sample code to demonstrate a simple normal distribution curve for random values
- Example 7 - sample code taken from Numpy.org's page to demonstrate a simple normal distribution curve
  - Note, this example runs across two cells

2. **Bionomial Distribution**
- Example 8 - toss a coin 10 times, tested 200 times
  - Example 8a - toss a coin 10 times, tested 2000 times
- Example 9 - sample code taken from Numpy.org's page to demonstrate a Binomial Distribution for an Oil Well Exploration

3. **Expotential Distribution**
- Example 10 - Waiting time to checkout

4. **Pareto Distribution**
- Example 11 - Pareto's Distribution Analysis - 80/20 Rule
  - Note, this example runs across two cells

5 **Zipf's Distribution**
- Example 12 - Zipfs Distribution
  - Note, this example runs across two cells


##### Section 4
The examples in this section are;
- Example 13 - Roll a 6 sided dice, 3 times
  - Example 13 a - Repeat example 13 to confirm same result
- 

##### Section 5
No examples are included in this section.
